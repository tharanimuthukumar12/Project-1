## ✨ Features

- Modular frontend-backend folder structure

## 💡 What I Learned
- React basics, props, states, and reusable components
- Express routing and MongoDB data operations (CRUD)
- Connecting frontend to backend using REST APIs
- Structuring a full-stack project for deployment
- Git and GitHub version control for code collaboration

> 🚀 This project helped me gain practical experience and confidence in full-stack web development.
